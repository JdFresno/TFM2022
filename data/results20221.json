The current information from Gwent Police is that only one lane on the bridge will be open and it is highly likely to go ahead. This will be between 7am and 7pm. There could also be disruption on the M48 Bridge which may well lead to only one lane being in use. We recommend you keep up-to-date with developments and apart from the usual news and traffic resources, www.walesonline.co.uk should also help you. For those travelling from the North or Midlands, Please consider taking the M50 to Monmouthshire and either re-join M4 at J24 Coldra, Newport, or Take the A40 at Raglan and join the A465 Heads of the Valley road and re-join M4 at J43 Swansea East.
